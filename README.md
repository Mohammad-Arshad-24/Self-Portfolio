# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using React.js! This website showcases my education, projects, skills, and ways to connect with me.

Features
This portfolio includes a fully responsive design that works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The website features a fixed navigation bar for smooth scrolling, animated sections for an engaging user experience, and a well-structured layout to showcase my projects and skills. The "Connect with Me" section is now placed in the footer for easy access.

Sections in the Portfolio
The homepage includes a full-screen background image along with an introduction about me. It also features a dynamic typing effect that highlights my core skills.

The education section displays my academic history, where each entry appears sequentially with a fade-in animation. The projects section showcases my work with descriptions and direct links to view them on GitHub.

The skills section lists my technical expertise and has been optimized to take only the necessary space instead of occupying a full screen. Finally, the footer contains links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email, making it easy for visitors to connect with me.

Technologies Used
This portfolio is built using React.js for a component-based UI structure. CSS3 is used to ensure a fully responsive and visually appealing design. JavaScript (ES6+) is implemented for interactive elements like animations and smooth transitions.

Installation & Setup
To set up this project, first, clone the repository using Git and navigate into the project folder. After that, install the required dependencies using npm. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server to run the project locally.
